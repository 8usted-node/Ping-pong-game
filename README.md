# Ping-pong-game
This is a simple classic ping pong game using Java.


To run this code, create a new Java project in your preferred IDE, copy the code into a file called PingPongGame.java, and then run the project.
The game will open in a new window, and you can control the paddles using the arrow keys and "W" and "S" keys.
The game will end if the ball goes past one of the paddles.
